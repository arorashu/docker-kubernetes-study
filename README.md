# Docker-study
Do a study of the docker technology, use on a simple application, and document results

## ECE-601 - Mini Project 3
This project is part of Mini Project 3 for Product Design Class at BU, Fall 2019.
Teammates: Shubham Arora & Krishna Chaitanya 

## Aim
We try to run the Spark Digital Equity WebApp: https://github.com/arorashu/spark-digital-equity.git
in docker. We will document the steps, compare app size, and deploy times.


## Results
 - There is no straight forward way to install Docker on Windows 10 Home
 - Docker does not work natively on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) as well 
 - Cannot install on SCC, as no install permissions (also not available as a module, or brewfile)
